In the beginning of July already, Matt Feinstein and JP Meijers cooperated and successfully installed another gateway in Greenpoint, Cape Town. We thank you! Great effort! 

With its unique position the gateway covers areas previously shielded by Signal Hill. From the radar plot it also becomes apparent that it enables many opportunities in nautical sciences and marine biology:

Certainly with room for improvement, now we have good coverage over Table Bay and False Bay. If you have use cases involving nautical sciences or marine biology, please [let us know](/contact). And naturally we're *always* looking for new community members, donors of gateways, and individuals as well as organsiations with access to high sites.
