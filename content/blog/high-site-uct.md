With great pride we announce to have completed the install of a The Things Network (TTN) gateway on the campus of the University of Cape Town (UCT). 

Special thanks hereby goes out to **Dr. David Johnson**, who next to granting us this great opportunity, also lead the install and provides patronage for the gateway. Thanks also goes out to [Michael Graaf](https://twitter.com/michaelgraaf) and [Eric Nitschke](https://twitter.com/EricNitschke) for assisting. Eric has provided some amazing photos under *CC BY-NC-SA* which are [available on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ericnitschke/sets/72157668378416087).

Initial coverage tests look very promising. But we'll continue long term tests and report on how the gateway has held up over time. Three key areas we are especially interested are 

- antenna performance and possible alternatives
- build quality under tough Capetonian weather conditions 
- coverage of the Southern Suburbs and Cape Flats
